          A Close Reading of Graham et al’s “Toward A Study of Information
          Geographies”
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">
          1. Description</p>
          <p>This is a summary and analysis of the paper “Toward A Study of
          Information Geographies”.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">
          2.Summary and Breakdown of the Paper</p>
          <p>The paper/Graham et al aims to collect to data about different
          information geographies and broadly analyse it to understand how
          information access and contribution on the web is distributed across
          the world.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">
          2.1 Information Geographies, Immutable Mobiles and (Im)mutable
          Augmentations
        </p>
        <p>
          The Paper refers to the concepts of Information Geographies,
          Mutability, Mutable Mobiles and (Im)mutable Augmentations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Geography refers to the context, meaning and origin of a
          piece of information. Graham et al states that “it is from somewhere,
          about somewhere”. In other words, information has meaning, and its
          origin and form of representation also has meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mutability refers to the tendency of something to change. The paper
          assumes Immutability to be something’s inability to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immutable Mobiles refers to information sets that can be physically
          moved across locations without “significant” change to its meaning.
          Their medium of representation is bound to a physical object and is
          also generally immutable. An example of this a book or newspaper,
          where the information is conveyed through print and paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Im(mutable) Augmentations refers to dynamic information sets with
          specific geographies but are not specifically mutable in their form or
          meaning. It can be both mutable and immutable. The information can be
          accessed across different locations without specifically needing to
          move the object. An example of this would be accessing an online
          article from a laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper outlines the transition from the “era of print” to the
          digital age, where (Im)mutable augmentations resulted from an
          evolution from Mutable Mobiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is explained that Im(mutable) Augmentations play an important role
          in the exposure and understanding of different places within the
          world. Representation of places and groups of people is also dependent
          on this.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">2.2 Pre-Digital Geographies of Information</p>
        <p>
          The ease of access to information in the Pre-Digital Era was limited,
          both in content and in location. The technological means of the time
          were not sufficient in allowing global mass contribution to
          information, nor could information be easily accessed across the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information sources such as books and texts were limited to
          institutions such as Universities and Associations, which were not
          widely accessible to the general public – if you could not travel to
          access where the information was located, then you could not access
          it. This meant that “knowledge and codified information” were
          “produced under conditions of power…exerting economic social, and
          political power”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper also points out that this meant that information sources
          such as books and patents were generally produced and also mainly
          about the Global North, whereas the Global South was the minority in
          this this production of information. This showed that the Global South
          had an unequal access to information and the socio-economic benefits
          that came with it.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">2.3 Changing Geographies After The Information Revolution</p>
        <p>
          The current period is considered an “Information Revolution”. The
          formation of digital technologies such as computers, which are more
          readily accessible now around the world, has led to an increase in the
          production, contribution and access to information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper notes positive opinions about this era, such as Tapscott and
          Williams(2006) and Shirky(2011), who believe that this greater access
          and contribution to information across the web can allow for citizens
          to “play a more significant role in shaping content and augmentations
          that play key roles in their lives”. It also notes the opinion that
          “For the first time in a millennium, we have a technology to equalize
          the opportunity that people have to access and participate in the
          construction of knowledge and culture, regardless of their geographic
          placing”(Lessig 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham et al seek to analyse global data to see if opinions like the
          ones above hold any truth. It is noted that 3 billion people have
          access to the global network, with 25 billion devices accessing that
          network. Graham et al also wish to use the data to see how this
          increased access to information affects political and economic
          geographies of information, as well at the participation and
          representation of information contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          To gain insight into this matter, Graham et all have conducted a
          research survey of “contemporary geographies key digital and
          internet-mediated processes”, which is split into the categories of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geographies of Access and Enablement</li>
          <li>Geographies of Participation</li>
          <li>Geographies of Representation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="boldTitle">2.4 Geographies of Access and Enablement</p>
        <p>
          This section of the paper details “who has access to the technologies
          and services essential for digital communication, participation and
          representation”. Access to the internet is required in order to
          participate in most forms of digital information contribution,
          therefore global scale data is required in order to investigate this
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper makes use of population data sets collected by the World
          Bank to track internet users and connection per country. It also makes
          use of data sets from the International Telecommunication Union to
          track the cost of broadband as a percentage of average income in a
          country.
        </p>
        <p>The main findings from the data were that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Asia accounts for the largest section in the world for internet
            users, at 42%
          </li>
          <li>
            Many of the largest internet nations have low a low percentage of
            internet users relative to their population
          </li>
          <li>As a whole, Africa has low internet penetration and growth</li>
          <li>
            The cost of broadband subscriptions is generally the highest in
            Africa.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It can be seen that generally Africa(as well as some other global
          south countries) has less access to internet than the rest of the
          world, and generally also has the highest broadband fees – making it
          further difficult to access the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">2.5 Geographies of Participation</p>
        <p>
          This is investigated through three variables, namely, Domain Names,
          Distributions of Collaborative Coding, and Geographies of Wikipedia
          Contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Domain Names are used to show the distribution of digital content
          around the world. The data set showed that 78% of domains are
          registered in North America and Europe, which indicates the
          “dominance…in internet content production”, that those regions hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          GitHub is the chosen metric to measure distributions of collaborative
          coding due the fact that it is the largest “code hosting service in
          the world”. The data set showed over North America and Europe each
          make up over 33%(1/3) of GitHub users across the world. Asia makes up
          17% of users, and Africa and the Middle East account for less than 1%
          of users. Graham et al also expressed that they expected the Africa
          and Middle East to have more GitHub users based on their level of
          internet access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wikipedia is “the world’s largest and most used encyclopaedia”, and
          allows for all internet users to contribute to it. The data sets
          showed that for a 2-year period, every 3 months, the United States,
          Germany, the United Kingdom and France each make over 1 million edits
          on Wikipedia. Comparatively, Africa and the Middle East only made a
          few thousand edits in the same time frame. Another data set was also
          used to track the percentages of origins of the Wikipedia edits for
          countries. The United States had 85% of edits made within its country,
          and similarly The United Kingdom had 78%. However, Africa showed low
          percentages, such as Nigeria with 16% and Kenya with 9%.
        </p>
        <p>
          These numbers indicate that the Global North creates the majority of
          digital content.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">2.5 Geographies of Representation</p>
        <p>
          This investigates representation of the world on the internet as a
          digital space. Data from Google Search, OpenStreetMap and the Semantic
          Web is used to analyse this digital representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Search data was used to analyse digital representation per
          country, based on the number of mentions/webpages that appear for a
          country in Google’s Index. The data showed the United States had the
          most mentions. Graham et al state that this is indicative of the
          information inequality across the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          “OpenStreetMap(OSM) is the world’s largest roadmap”. The data
          collected showed that the Global North accounted for the majority of
          all the content on the platform. The Global South is the minority of
          content, for example, Africa and Latin America each only make up 5% of
          the content on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semantic Web refers to common frameworks that are used to improve data
          efficiency on the web. Google acts as the primary web interface for
          the majority of Americans and Europeans. Back-end databases are used
          to “ feed’facts’ ” into engines like Google. The most important
          databases for this is Freebase and Geonames. The data set analysed
          showed that the majority of content hosted on these databases is
          related to the United States more than any other country.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">2.6 Graham et al Conclusions</p>
        <p>
          The paper reviews the geographies related to internet access and
          contributions. The paper indicates that there is unequal distribution
          of access and contribution of information geographies. It also
          demonstrates that there is little evidence to support the notion that
          increased access to the internet and technologies creates an increase
          in participation, contribution and representation of information
          geographies. It is generally seen that the Global North(often
          specifically the United States) has greater access, representation and
          contribution to the internet than countries in the Global South.
        </p>
        <p>
          The research conducted is broad starting point to further analyse the
          data collected. Further research and work must be conducted to analyse
          the context of the “uneven geographies”.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Aims</p>
        <p>
          The aim of the paper was to analyse collected data(both existing data
          and data that had not been previously collected or analysed) to
          understand information geographies and how they are distributed,
          accessed, participated in and represented in a global context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim is not to specifically gain any specific answer from the
          analysis of the data, but rather to see what questions are formed from
          the analysis, in order to create further work and study in the matter
          of information geographies.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Methodology</p>
        <p>
          To investigate the distribution, access, participation and
          representation of information geographies in a global context, Graham
          et al:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conducted a “broad-scale” global survey in three specific categories
            <ul>
              <li>Geographies of Access and Enablement</li>
              <li>Geographies of Participation</li>
              <li>Geographies of Representation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Collected data from established institutions and informants, such as
            Google, the International Telecommunications Union, and the World
            Bank
          </li>
          <li>Made use of bespoke data tools to generate their own data</li>
          <li>
            Analysed and provided statistical breakdowns of the data in both
            numerical and graphical forms
          </li>
          <li>
            Referenced other bodies of work for information, data collection and
            analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Limited the analysis of the collected data to the scale of a country
          </li>
          <li>
            Provided general analysis of the data between the Global North and
            South
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This methodology approach was effective in collecting reliable and
          (mostly)accurate data, and it was also effective in displaying this
          data to the reader in way that could be effectively visualised and
          understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of world maps, colours and sizing was effective in displaying
          the different distributions of data between the countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this methodology is effective in obtaining global scale data,
          it is not effective in providing data that can be analysed to
          understand the specific reasons for the different distributions. This
          is noted by Graham et al in the paper, and they state that the
          specific analysis of this is reserved for future research.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Results</p>
        <p>
          The results obtained by Graham et al show that in general there is
          uneven distribution of information geographies in the world, with the
          Global North tending to have greater access, distribution and
          representation compared to the Global South.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results show that 3 billion people have access to the internet,
          but the majority of digital content contribution and access to it lies
          with the Global North.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data obtained also shows that countries from the Global
          South(primarily African countries) have a high bandwidth cost.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Reflection on the Conclusions of Graham et al</p>
        <p>
          Based on the results mentioned above, it is clear that the Global
          South is at a disadvantage in terms of benefitting from the
          “information revolution” compared to the Global North. The paper does
          a thorough job in collecting reliable global data to come to this
          conclusion, and I agree with Graham et al’s position that this general
          global data needed to be collected and studied. However, some of these
          results seem predictable when reading the paper from a South African
          perspective. Graham et al acknowledge that the paper was written and
          published in Western Europe and so it is written from that specific
          view point, however, it would seem obvious to me as a South
          African(without needing to read this paper) that the Global North has
          greater access to the internet as well as its benefits than those in
          the Global South. This observation also helps to highlight the
          differences in the information geographies, as it aligns with the data
          collected in the paper – such as Google’s mentions of the North and US
          being greater than that of the South and regions like Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conclusions drawn in this paper are important in highlighting the
          issue of uneven information geographies, and as Graham et al point
          out, opening this field of study can prompt further study and analysis
          to take place. Further research can allow for greater insight to be
          gained into the issues and allow for solutions to be created, as well
          as create greater awareness of the topic.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Additional Research and Related Topics</p>
        <p>The Digital Divide[1][2]:</p>
        <p>
          The research in the paper can be related to the research on the
          Digital Divide(the topic is even mentioned in the paper when
          discussing broadband costs).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Digital Divide refers to the unequal access of technologies, such
          as computers and the internet, due to social and economic factors such
          as income, education, gender, and race. Briefly, individuals with more
          education, greater income and who don’t face discrimination due to
          race and gender generally have greater access to these technologies,
          and the benefits that come with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research has been conducted which shows that the above mentioned
          factors affect individuals access to technology. The research being
          conducted by Graham et al could also make use of the research
          conducted for the Digital Divide to help give context and
          understanding to the overall national data sets that they have
          collected.
        </p>
        <p>Web Crawlers[3][4]:</p>
        <p>
          The paper mentions domain names are used to make content findable. The
          paper also mentions that Search Engines such as Google make use of
          back-end databases to provide results for search queries. This relates
          to the topic of Web Crawlers. Web Crawlers search through webpages to
          scan for metadata and information related to the search query. The use
          of Web Crawlers is what allows Google to bring up the search results
          for the mentions of the United States of America on webpages(as
          mentioned in the paper for collection of data).
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be seen that Web Crawlers is an example of internet
          technologies that is used to help facilitate (Im)mutable augmentations
          on the internet, as it aids in the search, distribution and access of
          information for Search Engines on the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Suggested Avenues for further research</p>
        <p>
          Graham et al also state that this research was meant to open more
          topics of research and study, and that’s why they chose to
          specifically analyse the data at a country level. However, I believe
          that when studying the access and distributions of technologies such
          as the internet, it is also important to analyse economic factors of
          the countries involved. Factors such as the wealth of a country and
          their access to infrastructure also have an impact on the level access
          to the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further research should also be conducted into the different ways
          countries “contribute” to the information on the internet. Other
          metrics besides GitHub and Wikipedia contributions could provide
          further insight in how different regions contribute and participate in
          the internet. Potential avenues for this could be the amount of
          internet users in a country that use specific social media platforms
          such as Twitter and Instagram, as these are global platforms where
          users can contribute in expressing their opinions and identities.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Final Conclusions</p>
        <p>
          Graham et al draw an important conclusion(and maybe even an obvious
          one) that there is an uneven distribution of information geographies,
          where the Global North tends to have dominance over the South. Further
          research as to why this occurs should have been conducted to
          understand the context behind the data
