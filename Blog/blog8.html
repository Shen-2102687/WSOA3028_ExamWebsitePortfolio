            Analysis of the JavaScript Libraries used in this website
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Chosen Libraries</p>
        <p>For this assessment, I have chosen to implement the following two Javascript Libraries: slick.js and chart.js</p>
        <p>
            At the point of development before the implementation of these two libraries, the design goals for the user
            experience and creative implementation of the content of the website have already been achieved for the
            entirety of the website, except for the profile/home section. Currently, the profile/home page is just a brief text
            description of the website with nothing else on the page. Not only is this section lacking in expanded profile
            information, it is also lacking in creative implementation of the content on the page, compared to the rest of the
            website.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Augmenting the creativity of the website</p>
        <p>
            To address this and improve the creativity and content of this section, I have implemented a content summary
            using a carousel through the slick.js library to briefly show the content available on the website, and I have included a resume
            and visual display of my skillset through a graph using the chart.js library.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Implementation of slick.js</p>
        <p>
            The carousel feature of the library is used to automatically loop through the content as slides on a timer. The movement of the slides
            draws the user’s attention to the summary which increases their engagement with the website. The slides do not
            change/progress if the user is currently hovering over one, which allows the user to specifically read and engage
            with the content of a particular slide and prevent them from needing to wait and see the slide multiple times
            during the loop. The user can also click on the current slide they are viewing and it will direct them to the
            appropriate page of the related content, which allows for an intuitive form of navigation to the content. The user
            can also select specific slides to view by clicking on the corresponding dot bar below the slides.

        </p>
        <p>
            I specifically chose the slick.js library because of the simplicity of its implementation in the source code as well
            as for its extensive documentation on how to use the library. This specific library also had predefined methods to
            implement the carousel feature design that I required, which aided in decision to use this library.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Alternative solutions and implementations to slick.js</p>
        <p>
            The alternative libraries that could have been used to implement a similar feature include swiper.js and keen-slider.js. However,
            these libraries did not have detailed examples on implementing the desired scroll feature and the implementation
            for them were not as simple as the slick.js library, which would mean more development time would be required
            to implement and test the desired scroll feature. This is why the slick.js library was chosen over the other alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative method to augmenting the user experience of the blog list through animations was also
            considered, using the Anime.JS library. To address the creative implementation of the content summary when
            scrolling, animations could have been implemented to get each content entry to slide in from the left of the page
            to the centre as the user scrolled down the page, so that focus could be drawn to each specific entry at the
            current scroll point. This would have been an effective method to keep the user’s attention fixed on the list and
            emphasize the current content summary at that scroll point, however this could create potential tediousness
            when scrolling and it would also come at a potential performance cost, since the smoothness and loading of the
            animated list would be dependent on the the speed of the device’s internet connection as well as if the devices
            hardware specifications would be capable of immediately loading and displaying the animated list as desired.

        </p>
        <p>
            I have used websites before that have used animated transitions when scrolling through their webpages to
            display content and I have encountered issues with getting them to load correctly. For example, the Samsung
            website often implements animated scroll transitions to display information about a product that has been
            selected, but I have encountered issues where the content on the screen has taken a significant length of time to
            load, and while the remainder of the content is trying to load, the content that has loaded gets cut off and the
            remainder of the page is just blank. This occurred when I tried to use the Samsung website with a Samsung
            smartphone with 8GB of RAM and a fast internet connection of 100mb/s download and 100mb/s upload, which
            in theory would allow me to use the site with no lag issue, yet it still occurred. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This detracts from the engagement of the content on the site since there is no content being displayed to the
            user and it also creates frustration for the user since the content they are trying to access won’t load, potentially
            leading to them leaving the site and not engaging with the content at all. Based on this potential performance
            issue, I decided that this form of user experience augmentation was not worthwhile, especially considering the
            fact that this website is meant to be used as a portfolio website - if a potential employer tried to access a
            section of the website and it did not load, its entirely possible that they would just close the site and not attempt
            any further engagement with it.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Technical challenges faced using slick.js:</p>
        <p>
            While this library was simple to implement in comparison to the alternatives that could have been used, there
            were issues in regards to the functioning of the CSS of my website. The slick.js library implements its own CSS
            styling on the webpage that it is used, in order to correctly display the carousel, however I encountered some
            issues where the library’s CSS was overriding my own CSS, which would prevent some of the functions I
            implemented from working. To fix this, I had to use trial and error to find an HTML semantic markup structure
            that would prevent my CSS from being overridden. I was able to achieve this and the website is displayed and
            functions as desired, however this was an irritating experience since it increased the level of testing required to
            gain compatibility between the different CSS files. This is clearly a draw back of the library and showed me that
            the library is not perfect.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Implementation of chart.js</p>
        <p>I have also chosen to augment the creative display of my portfolio using the chart.js library. </p>
        <p>
            For this assignment, I have decided to expand my profile and portfolio on the website with the inclusion of a
            Resume. The chart.js library is used to visually display my level of experience with certain code languages and
            technologies as a listed graph. This allows the user to visualize my level of experience rather than just reading it
            as a number on the CV.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Alternative solution to chart.js</p>
        <p>
            An alternate implementation of this would be to simply create a graph of this as an image an implement the
            image directly on the website. However, the chart.js implementation is suitable for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The graph can be scaled and displayed more efficiently using CSS for smaller screen sizes, whereas an image
                    would simply be made smaller for smaller screen sizes, which can lead to potential compression issues where
                    information on the image(such as text) could become blurry, whereas scaling a directly implemented graph
                    does not have this issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The graph values can be edited at any time and the information updated automatically on the website. So as I
                    progress in my career and skills, the level of proficiency in a language can be edited or the addition of a new
                    language/skill could be added without needing to make the entire graph from scratch and reimplementing it as
                    an image again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation for the graph only plays once when it is loaded for the first time, so it does not have the same performance drawback
                    constant animated transitions when scrolling(as mentioned earlier).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Technical challenges faced using chart.js:</p>
        <p>
            This library was also simple to implement and use, however there is one draw back in terms of its responsive
            design. The actual graph scales down appropriately for smaller screen sizes and all the elements are displayed
            correctly, however the text labels for the graph do not scale appropriately. The labels do not decrease in size but
            rather labels will disappear as needed to fit only a few labels on the y-axis of the graph. This cannot be fixed
            using CSS styling as it simply how the library functions to implement its label system. However, even though not
            all the labels will be displayed on smaller screen sizes on the y-axis of the graph, the label and respective bar
            can still be identified by clicking on the bar, which will bring up a pop up label with information about the bar. So
            this has prevented any issue from occuring in correctly identifying the label and value of a bar.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
            The use of these two libraries allowed me to achieve the design goal for the home/profile page to have a creative
            and engaging implementation that would draw the user’s attention to the content of the page.
