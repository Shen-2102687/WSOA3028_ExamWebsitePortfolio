        <p class="p-name">What is a browser? How do they work?</p>
        <p>
          What is a browser and examples of web browsers: A browser is a type of
          software application that allows users to access information and
          content on the World Wide Web(the internet). The web browser uses a
          client/server interaction to function. The browser acts as the client,
          which requests access to information from a server to be displayed by
          the browser for the user to view[1] [2][3][4].
        </p>
        <p>
          A web browser can give a user access to different types of information
          and content on the internet, such as websites, webpages, PDFs, images,
          videos and files[4][5][6].
        </p>
        <p>
          A web browser is comprised of several User Interface(UI) components
          that allow users to use the browser to navigate the internet[1][3].
          These include things such as:
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • A Search Bar: This is a section to allow the user to enter a URL to
          access a specific website, or search a specific topic on the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • Tabs: These are rectangular UI elements that allow the user to have
          multiple websites and webpages open at the same time. The design of a
          tab is similar to the design of folder tabs used in a physical filing
          systems. This allows the user to quickly switch and navigate between
          different tabs to access different information as needed.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • Navigation tools and buttons: These are usually represented by icons
          such as arrows or boxes that allow the user to move back and forth
          between different webpages on a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          There a several commonly used web browsers which include[1][2]:
          <ul>
              <li>Google Chrome</li>
              <li>Safari</li>
              <li>Firefox</li>
              <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple example of using a web browser would be: Using the Google
          Chrome web browser to access the website YouTube by searching for the
          URL: https://www.youtube.com in the search bar.
        </p>
        <p>How do web browsers work[1][2][4][5][6]:</p>
        <p>
          The high-level architecture of a web browser can be broken into the
          following main components:
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The User Interface: This details the elements in the browser that
          the user interacts with in order to access the internet. These include
          some of the previously described elements such as the Search Bar,
          Tabs, and Navigation Tools.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The Browser Engine: This controls the interactions and actions that
          occur between the User Interface and The Rendering Engine.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The Rendering Engine: This renders the requested information or
          webpage so that it can be displayed for the user to view on the web
          browser. The rendering engine can interpret HTML and CSS and convert
          it into the necessary format that will allow the user to view the
          website as intended.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The Networking Component: This handles the internet communication
          and the internet security of the browser. The networking component
          will use protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP),
          Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS) and File Transfer
          Protocol(FTP), to retrieve URLs and access the requested website or
          webpage.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The JavaScript Interpreter: If website makes use of JavaScript code,
          then this component will interpret and execute that code, and then
          send it to the Rendering Engine so that it can be processed and
          displayed to the user.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The Backend User Interface: This section is used to create basic
          User Interface elements such as boxes.
        </p>
        <p class="pointIndent">
          • The Data Storage Component: This component creates a database on the
          local drive of the device on which the browser is installed. The
          database is then used to manage data such cookies and cache. Cookies
          are used by the website to retain user data and information such as
          usernames and passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these components function together to allow the user to have a
          smooth browsing experience when using a web browser to access the
          internet.
