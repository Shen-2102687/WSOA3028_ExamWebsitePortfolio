      2nd Critical Reflection on the Technical, Creative and Development Process of

          2nd Critical Reflection on the Technical, Creative and Development Process
          of this Website
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1st Critical Reflection details the development and reflection of the website from Assigment 1 to Assignment 2, this
            post will detail the development and reflection from the end of Assignment 2 to this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website has followed an iterative design and development process, building upon what was created for
            Assignment 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Technical:</p>
        <p>
            The semantic and technical practices detailed in the previous reflection post have also been followed for this  
            assignment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The main technical progress and change for this iteration of the website is the use of Javascript librariers to
            augment the creative aspect of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            The technical reasoning behind the chosen Javascript libraries is that they were simple to implement in my
            source code. This allowed for quick implementation and testing to occur, which aided in the iterative
            development of the website. Detailed reasonings for the use of these libraries is explained in the blog
            post for the implementation and analysis of the JavaScript Libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of JavaScript variables for these librariers is inline with the documentation on how to implement these libraries 
            into the website. The different Libraries use different variables for different purposes, so the use of variables for them 
            is based on their specific requirements in their documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The wireframes document implementation for the website has also been slightly changed. The wireframes were originally directly implemented on the website
            as images to allow for better user engagement, however the images were scaled incorrectly which lead to the text of the
            wireframes to appear slightly blurred, which raised a concern for the accessibility considerations of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address this issue the images for the wireframe diagrams were scaled down and the text for the paragraphs became clearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is the potential for the text used to detail some of the diagrams to become slightly blurred if the user zooms in alot on the image,
          however this cannot be avoided since the images have been compressed for image and performance optimisation, so the images cannot be any
          clearer than how they currently appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Text that pertained to reasonings and explanations for the wireframe decisions were changed from images to actual text implemented
          directly on the website. This eliminated the blur on the text and now the document is clearly visible and legible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another concern was raised in relation to the wireframes in that all the wireframe documentation were implemented as images, which
            limits the accessibility of the documents. This is no longer a concern because of the above changes. The detailed explanations for the
            design decions are implmented as clear text which increases the accessibility of the document. Diagrams that have been used to show the
            wireframes are all given appropriate alternate text descriptions as well to aid in the accessibility of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            A PDF version of the entire wireframe documentation is available for download on the page which can be used as an alternative accessibility method to
            view the wireframes.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Creative:</p>
        <p>
            As mentioned in the previous reflection post, the creativity design goals for the website were achieved in
            Assignment 2, however the the creativity of the home/profile page was still lacking an implementation that would
            interest the user and increase their engagement with the website. The home/profile page was simply a box with
            some text to describe the content of the website. Visually, even though it aligns with the overall design aesthetic
            of the website, it is boring and uninteresting, and needed to be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve the creative implementation of this section, both my profile and the content of the page were
            expanded. For the detailed technical and creative implementation of this, please refer to the blog post for JavaScript
            Libraries analysis and implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            A carousel was added to display a summary of the content of the website. The carousel automatically loops
            through the different sections within it. The content of the carousel has been implemented as custom drawn
            images that briefly explain the appropriate sections of the website. The visual movement along with the colourful
            art of the carousel creates a visually interesting form of content display that attracts the userâ€™s attention, which
            aids in emphasizing the content of the website to them.

        </p>
        <p>
            An animated bar graph was implemented to add a visual display of my skillset and experience, and is used to
            augment the resume that was added to the home page. The animation of the graph visually displays the
            progress of my skillset through the movement of the line for each skillset. The animation is only played once when
            the page is loaded to ensure there are no performance drawbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            This also creates a visually interesting display to the user and helps draw their attention to this section of the
            webpage. It also acts as an informative summary of my most useful skills, and acts as both introduction to my
            resume or replaces the need to read it should the user find the necessary information from the graph alone.
        </p>
        <p>Further responsive design has been added</p>
        <p>
            The version of the website for Assignment 2 catered towards 3 distinct viewport displays for laptop/desktop,
            tablet and mobile. However, the website display was only guaranteed to function correctly for these 3 viewports.
            For this current version of the website, responsive design has been added for all viewports. The website will
            collapse accordingly with no spacing or display errors for all viewports. This change allows anyone to access my portfolio website on any device. This aids in increasing the device accessibility of the website.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Overall Thoughts</p>
        <p>
            The iterative development of this website over the semester was useful in allowing for developmental focus to be
            placed on improvement and implementation of the brief requirements for each specific assignment, ie more time
            could be spent on the important aspects that were required to be implemented for each assignment since I did
            not need to start from scratch each time and build a website from the ground up for each assignment. 

        </p>
        <p>
            This allowed me to create a website that both achieved all the design goals that I set for each assignment and
            that I could be proud to submit.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
            The development of this website was a long iterative process that spanned the entire semester as well as all the assignments
            for this course, but all the time and effort spent in developing this website has allowed me to produce a website that meets all
            the requirements of the assignment brief as well as allowing me to achieve all my design goals exactly as I desired.
