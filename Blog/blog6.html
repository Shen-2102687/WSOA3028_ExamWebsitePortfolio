        <p>
          The research that I have engaged with for this writing all relate to
          the broad topic of Digital Equality and discuss the different factors
          that affect society’s current standing in relation to Digital
          Equality.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">What is Digital Equality?</p>
        <p>
          Digital Equality is the equal access and use of digital
          technologies[1][2]. This topic seems to be a branch off of the issue
          of the Digital Divide – the differences in access and use of digital
          technologies and the internet between different parts of the world.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">What does Digital Equality Aim to Address?</p>
        <p>
          Digital Equality aims to address the inequalities that have emerged
          from the Digital Divide. The world is becoming increasingly reliant on
          the internet to facilitate things such education, research, business,
          commerce, and communication. Lack of access to digital devices and
          internet results in lack of access to all of the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          People around the world already face a lack of access to these things
          in the physical world and by not having access to them they face an
          increased disadvantage in the world compared to those who have access
          to both physical and digital resources[1][2][3].
        </p>
        <p>
          The Covid-19 Pandemic has also demonstrated society’s increasing
          reliance on technology to be able to function[3][4][5]. Having access
          to digital devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones, as well
          as access to internet were(and still are) vital to keep the world and
          the economy functioning in the Pandemic, since most forms of business
          and education were forced to switch to online alternatives to comply
          with social-distancing measures – meaning the ability to work and
          access to education became reliant on having a device and internet
          connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          In instances like these, the most vulnerable, such as victims of
          poverty and unstable political situations, are the ones who suffer the
          most, since they cannot easily access the same resources as those who
          have financial privilege.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">How is this addressed and implemented?</p>
        <p>
          The ultimate goal is for issues, like the ones raised above, to be
          addressed through governmental policy and legislature, as well as
          funding and aid from private organisations and institutions[1][4[5].
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, governments and institutions
          around the world provided aid and resources in the form of devices and
          internet services to those in need so that they could access schooling
          and work resources.
        </p>
        <p>Some examples include[3]:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The UK government providing loan devices for students in need</li>
          <li>
            Students in Egypt being provided free SIM cards and subsidised
            internet costs
          </li>
          <li>Mobile users in Thailand receiving free monthly data</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="boldTitle">Achieving Digital Equality?</p>
        <p>
          So the issues raised above have been addressed through specific
          methods of increasing digital equality, such as education on how to
          use the internet, providing resources such as devices and internet
          broadband[3][4][5], but does this actually bridge the gap and create
          digital equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing programmes and resources to ensure people have access to
          digital devices and an internet connection is great, and this can help
          provide disadvantaged groups with greater opportunities, but this does
          not address the root issue of why Digital Equality does not exist in
          the first place, nor does it address how the level access to
          technologies affects people’s capacity to benefit from digital
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that the level of access that a person has to the internet
          and digital technologies directly increases the benefits that they can
          gain from using those technologies. A noted statistic is that “about
          59% of the global population having access to the internet by the
          spring of 2020”[5], which clearly implies that a significant majority
          of the world has internet access, however this does not address the
          differences in level of access. I doubt that the majority of this
          portion of the population has unlimited/uncapped internet access, and
          the likely scenario is that most have limited budget of data that they
          can use every month. This context immediately changes how Digital
          Equality should be viewed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, consider 2 students who both have to use online schooling
          as a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where one student only has a
          small tablet and receives 1GB of data a month, and the other student
          has a smartphone, laptop, and tablet and has uncapped Wi-Fi at home.
          Both these students have access to a device and internet and learning,
          so therefore are they not Digitally Equal? I disagree. The second
          student has more devices and greater access to the internet, and this
          gives them an advantage over the first student in being able to fully
          utilise online learning, since they do not have to worry about their
          device usage or their internet usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though this is a small scale scenario, it is useful in
          demonstrating that Digital Equality cannot simply undo the imbalances
          that already exist in society, since the underlying root cause has not
          been address.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that Digital Equality is a result of economic inequality and
          the capitalistic system that world has adopted. Digital Equality
          cannot be truly achieved until the underlying economic inequalities
          that caused it are addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some examples of economic inequalities that need to be addressed
          before Digital Equality can be achieved are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Equal access to healthcare</li>
          <li>Equal access to electricity</li>
          <li>Equal access to food and water</li>
          <li>Equal access to housing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are all issues that need to be addressed by governments to
          ensure that those who live in suffering and poverty can live better
          lives. These issues also directly affect how people can make use of
          digital technologies to their advantage, assuming they already have
          access to technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, consider a specific South African context: What happens
          during load shedding and people do not have access to electricity for
          school and work? The privileged and rich can afford to use generators
          or alternative power solutions during these outages, and so they can
          continue to work and access learning material, whereas the poor do not
          have these same luxuries, and are forced to wait for the situation to
          be fixed. This difference in economic equality directly affects
          people’s ability to take advantage of the benefits that digital
          technologies can offer, and therefore hinders Digital Equality from
          being achieved.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
          Achieving Digital Equality is an important goal, especially in the
          digital age we live in where many of our services, resources,
          businesses and education are moving to digital platforms. Even though
          working towards solving digital inequality is important, and some of
          the programmes and aids given by governments are a great starting
          point to alleviate the issue, the only way to truly achieve Digital
          Equality is to ensure that governments also address economic
          inequalities and create policies and measures that address and fix
          these inequalities. Only then will Digital Equality become an
          achievable goal.
