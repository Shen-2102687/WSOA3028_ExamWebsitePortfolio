        <p class="p-name">The Uses of Metadata - What, Why and How?</p>
        <p>
          What is Metadata?<br />
          Metadata refers to one set of data that is used to explain or describe
          another set of data. Specifically, in terms of the internet, Metadata
          refers to HTML elements that are used to communicate information about
          a website to a Search Engine that is trying to access information
          about that website[1][2][3][4][5].
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is Metadata Used?<br />
          As mentioned previously, Metadata communicates information about a
          website to a Search Engine. Search Engines make use of Web Crawlers to
          aid in providing search results to a user. The Web Crawlers search
          through webpages on the internet and search through links that appear
          on those webpages. During this process, data is retrieved from those
          webpages and links, and sent to the search engine so that it can
          process it[6][7].
        </p>
        <p>
          The Search Engine then Indexes this data. The data is stored and
          organised for the Search Engine to create a list of content that will
          be potentially shown to user[6][7].
        </p>
        <p>
          The Search Engine then Ranks the stored data and content. The Ranking
          process organises the data and content in the order that the best
          suits the user’s search query, according to the Search Engine[6][7].
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose of Metadata is to optimise the Search Engine process
          of categorising and ranking websites as well as relevant information
          about those websites to communicate it to users. The user is then able
          to determine if the website is relevant to their search request.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for example, if you were to use the search engine Google to search
          for “shoe stores”, the Metadata that Google collects from different
          webpages during its crawling process determines what links, text and
          descriptions will be shown to you on the results page, as well as what
          order that information is displayed on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is Metadata Used and Processed?<br />
          Metadata is comprised of Metadata Elements such as Tags and
          Descriptions. Meta Tags are used to hold important keyword
          descriptions and information of websites. An example of this is the
          Meta Tag, which is used to provide the Title of a website to the
          Search Engine so that it can determine the content of the website. A
          Meta Description is used to summarise the purpose of website and its
          content. The Search Engine uses these to determine if the website is
          relevant to the user’s search request and after the data has been
          indexed and ranked, it is displayed to the user[1][3][4][5].
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta Tags and Descriptions are vital for Search Engines to determine
          the relevance of a website to a search query, since the Meta Title Tag
          and Description is what will be shown to the user on the results page.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident that Metadata plays a key role in the successful
          functioning of a Search Engine so that users can enjoy a streamlined
          search process on the internet.
