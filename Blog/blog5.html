        <p class="p-name">A Critical Analysis of my UX and UI</p>
        <p class="boldTitle">What is UX?</p>
        <p>
          UX is defined as “User Experience”. This definition is quite vague and
          can have multiple interpretations, as noted by Marc Hassenzahl and
          Noam Tractinsky[1]. For the purpose of my portfolio website, I have
          chosen to define “User Experience” as the design principles and
          practices that are implemented which inform how the user interacts
          with and navigates the website.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">What is UI?</p>
        <p>
          UI is the aesthetic and cosmetic design of the website. It is the
          visual design and representation of the website[2].
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">How is this implemented</p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Main goal:</p>
        <p>
          The main goal for my website design is to achieve a minimalistic and
          neat design that is both easy and intuitive to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following design decisions have been made to attempt to achieve
          this goal:
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Colour:</p>
        <p>
          To achieve the minimalist and neat design aesthetic, I have made use
          of minimal colour in the website. The main source of colour is the Nav
          Bar, a pale dark blue. The rest of the website is comprised of white
          and grey tones to contrast the Nav Bar, this allows the user’s sight
          to be drawn to the Nav Bar, which indicates to the user what content
          they can find on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          These pale and feint colours were also chosen so that the user’s eyes
          do not become strained when browsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colour of the text on the Nav Bar is a feint white on the orange
          spectrum. This was done to allow the font to stand out against the
          dark blue on the Nav Bar, since orange and blue are complementary
          colours, and plain white would cause discomfort to the user’s eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The font colour for rest of the website is plain black. It contrasts
          the feint white backgrounds and allows for the text to be comfortably
          read.
        </p>
        <p>Selectable elements are highlighted when hovered over.</p>
        <p>
          The colour of the Nav Bar highlights is also a pale white on the
          orange spectrum(but a different colour to the Nav Bar Text), to allow
          the highlight to stand out against the blue Nav Bar(similar to the
          text reasoning).
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper-card elements are highlighted in a feint grey to contrast
          the light background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highlighting selectable elements in contrasting colours help emphasize
          that the element is selectable/has been selected.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Font</p>
        <p>
          The serif font “Times New Roman” was chosen for all text elements on
          the website. This font offered easier and more comfortable reading
          compared to sans-serif fonts. As noted by Peta Goldberg, serif fonts
          have better readability than sans-serif fonts[2]. This font also helps
          the text look simple and elegant which aids in achieving the clean and
          neat aesthetic goal of the website design.
        </p>
        <p>
          When conducting research for font types, several articles such as “The
          7 Best Modern Fonts for Websites” by Justin Morales[3], suggest that
          sans-serif fonts provide a sophisticated and minimalistic look to the
          text. However, when I tried to implement sans-serif fonts such as
          Verdana and Arial, the text looked cartoonish and was uncomfortable to
          read in comparison to the serif fonts. So this is why a serif-based
          font has been used for my website.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Layout</p>
        <p>
          The layout for each page was designed to feel neat and not cluttered.
          There are only a few elements on each page, and all the elements are
          placed centrally. This creates open space on the left and right sides
          of each page, which in turn helps to make the elements the focal
          points of the page. Peta Goldberg discusses how creating a focal point
          creates an area of interest, so by making the content on a webpage the
          focal point, the user is naturally guided towards it, which helps them
          engage with the content of the page[2].
        </p>
        <p>
          Peta Goldberg also discusses the importance of maintaining composition
          in website so that design feels intentional, consistent, and pleasing
          to view[2]. The visual weight, balance and alignment differs on each
          page depending on the content of the page. The Games and Code Projects
          pages each only have 2 selectable items, so the items were placed
          centrally and side by side in order to create symmetrical balance. The
          Blogs page has 3 items on it(and will have more in the future), so the
          items are placed centrally underneath one another to create radial
          balance. Since the items on this page are blog posts, this layout aims
          to keep in convention with the layout of popular social media
          platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, where posts are
          placed one under the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nav Bar is placed at the top of the website but is not pinned to
          the top of the user’s screen while they scroll through the site. This
          allows the user to engage with the content of the website without the
          Nav Bar distracting the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Footer is placed at the bottom of the page, this indicates the end
          of the page’s content and also serves to indicate the copyright
          information of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I implemented the Law of Locality to help the design of the website
          feel intuitive for users[2].
        </p>
        <p>The Law of Locality</p>
        <p>
          Law 1: Put an element where it will effect change<br />Law 2: If an
          element changes an entire area, put it above the area<br />Law 3: If
          an element is far from where it effects change, make it pop
        </p>
        <p>The layout of my website makes use of Laws 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>
          The Nav Bar makes change across the entire webpage area when a section
          is selected, so it has been placed at the top of the website, since it
          will change the area underneath it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The selectable items on the pages are placed where they will affect
          change. For example, on the Games page selecting a game from the list
          will change what is displayed on that page.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Selectable elements</p>
        <p>
          Elements that are selectable lists or buttons are designed to look
          like paper-cards. This was done to create a neat aesthetic. This
          decision was also made in order to provide a small feeling of depth,
          so that the elements would not feel flat and dull, and also to
          contrast them from the flat background to show that they are
          interactable.
        </p>
        <p>
          These elements as well as logos on the Games page, are given rounded
          corners. Peta Goldberg mentions that rounded corners on elements offer
          a friendly and positive mood[2]. Since this is a portfolio website to
          showcase our skills, I wanted the elements to feel welcoming and
          friendly, to encourage interaction from the user.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Informing user of options and decisions</p>
        <p>
          In order to inform the user of changes and decisions on the website,
          all content that is selectable is highlighted when it is hovered over.
        </p>
        <p>
          To inform the user of the current page they are on, the current page
          text is always highlighted on the Nav Bar. This is an implementation
          of the Von Restorff Effect – when multiple similar objects are
          present, one that differs from the rest is most likely remembered.
          This helps prevent confusion when navigating the website[2] . When
          selecting a page from the Nav Bar, the highlighted block displayed is
          smaller than the block of the current page. This is to prevent
          confusion for what is currently displayed and what is being selected.
          This also gives the user confirmation of their selection if they
          change pages, since the highlight size will increase and remain in
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also navigation within the pages so that the user does not
          have to only rely on the Nav Bar. Where applicable, if a user selects
          an item from a list on a page, there is a button at the bottom of the
          content of that page to allow the user to return to the list. This
          allows the user to return to the list faster than if they were to use
          the Nav Bar. This is a simple implementation of Hick’s Law, since
          there are only 2 options presented to the user, they can make a quick
          decision of where they want to navigate to next. Either they return to
          the list or they use the Nav Bar to go to a new section of the
          website[2].
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Reflection on Implementation</p>
        <p>
          I believe that I have implemented good UX and UI practices to achieve
          my goal of creating a minimalistic website design that is easy and
          intuitive to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website informs the user of potential decisions they can make, as
          well as confirmations of their decisions, it provides the user with
          easy and meaningful navigation, and the font, colour and text
          decisions allow the user to comfortably engage with the website
          without feeling strain or discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite succeeding in my initial goals for this website, there are 2
          main faults in the UX and UI design:
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Limited Viewports:</p>
        <p>
          The website has not been designed to account for screen sizes other
          than 1920x1080 pixel screens. The website does not render correctly on
          smaller screen devices, such as tablets and phones. The elements and
          text all collapse on one another or move out of place and the site is
          unusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is poor web design and limits the amount of people who are able
          to engage with the website. This design also does not follow
          Responsive Web Design principles[2].
        </p>
        <p>
          This issue will be addressed and Responsive Design for different
          viewports will be added during the continued development of this
          website.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Difficulty reading the wireframes:</p>
        <p>
          The wireframes for this website were provided as an embedded pdf on
          the Wireframes page. However, this design makes it difficult to read
          and engage with the content of the wireframes. While I have also
          included a download option to download and open the pdf separately,
          which would be easier to read than an embedded pdf, this also creates
          a new issue of the user needing to leave the website to read the
          wireframe. This decreases the engagement from the user and can cause
          frustration from the lack of ease for reading the wireframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          This issue will also be addressed during the development of the
          website. Instead of the wireframes being displayed as an embedded pdf,
          they will rather just be directly placed on the webpage using HTML and
          CSS. This will allow for easier and more comfortable reading.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
          It is evident that good UX and UI practices have been implemented, but
          there is still some room to improve to allow the user to a better
          experience.
