      A reflection of Simon Harper’s reflection of “As We May Think”
    </h1>

      <article class="h-entry">
        <p class="p-name">A reflection of Simon Harper’s reflection of “As We May Think”</p>
        <p>
          Harper begins his reflection by recounting the importance that “As We
          May Think” had in creating new areas of study and research. He notes
          that some people consider the concepts from the text to be outdated,
          however he disagrees and thinks the concept of thought and association
          within human thinking is still relevant today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harper proceeds to discuss a machine that Bush created, called the
          Differential Analyser. It was a mechanical device that could solve
          mathematical differential equations. He discusses how the machine
          represented Bush’s way of thinking, taking abstract mathematical
          concepts and using physical means to demonstrate their operations and
          functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harper goes on to discuss Bush’s proposal of the MEMEX, a mechanised
          system where information could be sorted and retrieved for an
          individual. He discusses Bush’s ideas on human minds linking thoughts
          through association as opposed to an arbitrarily sorted index.
        </p>
        <p>
          He ends his reflection by praising Bush for providing his concept on
          how large scale information could be stored and managed for an
          individual to help them better understand and investigate new concepts
          in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that this text highlights two important details. The first
          being that people don’t think in a static and index-based thought
          process, but rather that our thoughts are interconnected and jump from
          one to the other based on some form of association from the previous
          thought. Secondly, using this association of thought can help us
          better interpret pieces of information and learn concepts more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think these two concepts are important when working in any sort of
          software-based framework, whether it be video games, apps, websites or
          simple programmes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of designing any of the above, I think it is useful to take
          the two points mentioned above and include them in the design process.
          When we use any form of software, we prefer when things feel intuitive
          and feel like they “make sense”. I think that one could take the
          concepts of association of thought to create a well designed
          user-experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see how these concepts are already applied to software that has
          a good user-experience. Websites that are easy to use will often have
          the navigation based in categories that are broken down into
          sub-categories that were related to the main category. For instance, a
          main category of Gaming could be broken into sub-categories such as
          Video Games, Accessories, Consoles, Chairs ect. This shows how you
          could navigate through the website through association of information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of how using this sort of association to learn concepts more
          easily can be shown in how many well-designed apps are designed with
          an intuitive interface. For example, if you use an app like Twitter,
          it probably won’t be too difficult for you to figure out how Reddit
          works and vice versa. Or if you use a messaging app like Whatsapp as
          well as posting-based app like Instagram, it wouldn’t be too difficult
          to figure out how SnapChat works. If you use multiple social media
          platforms, then you increase your “vocabulary” on how different apps
          and websites work, and in turn you can probably figure out how to use
          most other apps and websites, provided they aren’t designed horribly
          for the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think we can also see that information on apps and websites are
          being grouped by attempted association more often now in an attempt to
          make the user-experience more fluid. For example, how Instagram uses
          an algorithm to bring up content you might like based on previous
          content that the algorithm has seen that you enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think its intriguing to see how Bush’s idea of grouping information
          through association is being used so many decades later, even if its
          not in the exact way he intended(such as memes and similar content on
          social media), and it is also clear that Harper was correct in stating
          that Bush’s ideas weren’t outdated since we clearly still do use them
          today.
