      Critical Reflection on the Technical, Creative and Development Process of
      this Website</h1>

      <article class="h-entry">
        <p class="p-name">
          Critical Reflection on the Technical, Creative and Development Process
          of this Website
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Website Development Process</p>
        <p>
          The development of this website was an iterative process, building
          upon what was created in Assignment 1. The website has been designed
          to meet the specifications of the assignment brief and has followed
          conventional practices.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Technical Development and Reflection</p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Use of Semantic Markup:</p>
        <p>
          I have implemented consistent and appropriate Semantic Markup
          throughout the website. Some examples of this include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using p tags for paragraph text</li>
          <li>Using article tags to define articles of text</li>
          <li>Using section tags to define specific sections of the website</li>
          <li>Using nav tags for navigation elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The full extent of the semantic markup is reflected in the HTML source
          code for this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using good Semantic Markup has also simplified the styling process of
          the website. Elements were easily accessible in the stylesheet and the
          positioning and design of elements were simplified by the Semantic
          Markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example(this is an oversimplified example), large sections of text
          such as a blog post were structured in the following manner:
        </p>
        <p>"(section)(article)(p)(/p)(p)(/p)(/article)(/section)"</p>
        <p>
          To move the entire body of text, only the section tag would need to be
          accessed via a class to do this, as opposed to needing to create a
          class for each p tag and move each one individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS and JavaScript have also been externally linked to the HTML and
          there is not styling or script implemented directly in the HTML
          document.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Search Engine Optimisation(SEO):</p>
        <p>
          SEO has been implemented in through the use of appropriate Metadata
          tags, Headers and Microformats. The use of elements allows for Web
          Crawlers to access appropriate information about the site and use it
          for search query result purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Responsive Design:</p>
        <p>
          The website makes use of Responsive Design that caters to 3 distinct
          form factors. The specific styling and design choices behind this is
          detailed later in this document, as well as in the design page of this
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technical implementation of the Responsive Design was done through
          media queries in the CSS, this allowed for breakpoints to be created
          for when the design should change based on the device viewport.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Performance:</p>
        <p>
          To ensure optimised performance of the website, all images that have
          been used are small in file size. Where appropriate(such as the
          wireframes), the images have been implemented as transparent PNG
          files, to only show necessary information and decrease the file size
          needed for the image. This also allows for the content to blend in
          with the rest of the website as the background of the images will
          simply be the body of the website.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">JavaScript:</p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is mainly used to serve functional purposes on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation of the website is controlled by JavaScript. A
          navigation function is called whenever a navigation element is clicked
          and is given the specific navigation parameter for that element. The
          navigation function takes in the parameter and uses switch cases to
          determine where the website must navigate to based on that input
          parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method of navigation works perfectly for the content scope of
          this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another method that was considered for the navigation was to use
          JavaScript to dynamically generate the navigation elements and
          implement them in the HTML documentation based on where and what the
          user is doing. This method would consist of creating navigation
          elements through DOM manipulation in a separate JavaScript file which
          would then determine what elements are needed on the page that is
          being accessed, and through DOM manipulation the elements would be
          appended to the HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method would be useful since it can dynamically generate the
          navigation elements needed for a page without needing them to be
          manually coded in the HTML, and this would be useful for large content
          websites with lots of navigation points – such as Amazon, which has
          millions of pages for products and required dynamic navigation for
          efficiency and optimisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, for the purposes of this small scale portfolio website, the
          amount of code needed to create this dynamic generation would
          significantly outweigh the code needed to create the JavaScript
          navigation as it stands now, and so it is not justifiable to use this
          as an efficient solution for the navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has also been used to create a mobile navigation menu. DOM
          manipulation is used to determine when the user has clicked the menu
          bar and the navigation tab is displayed/toggled appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has also been implemented to create a sort function for the
          blog posts where they can be sorted in order of most recent or oldest
          posts. The implementation of this function is short and simple because
          the blogs were created using a flex display with a column direction.
          DOM manipulation is used to sort the blogs by reversing the current
          direction of the blogs column based on the user selection. This method
          to sort by date/time does not require intensive traversing of elements
          and nodes because the flex implementation of the blogs already gives
          them a default order based on the order in which they are listed in
          the HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also used JavaScript as method of informing the user of their
          actions on the website. If a user clicks on a download link for a game
          or code project, a browser alert message is displayed to the user to
          inform them that they will be taken to my GitHub page. This is to
          ensure the user is aware of what is happening and does not suddenly
          become confused as to why a new tab has been opened.
        </p>
        <p>
          The JavaScript functions are also separated into responsibilities for
          DOM Manipulation and Data Processing for efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the JavaScript functions do not exceed 8 lines unless
          necessary. The Navigation function exceeds 8 lines because of the
          processing required for the switch cases. Breaking the function into
          multiple functions would create more lines of code in total than this
          single function, so this is the most efficient implementation of this
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          The usage of JavaScript in the website is efficient and facilities
          functional usage and user feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Technical implementation of CSS:</p>
        <p class="boldTitle">General Techniques</p>
        <p>
          To ensure consistency in the code implementation of the CSS, I have
          designated specific uses for classes and ID’s as CSS selectors.
          Classes are only used to add styling to the HTML elements via the
          stylesheet, and ID’s are only used for the purpose of DOM manipulation
          for JavaScript functions.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Specific Techniques</p>
        <p>
          Visually, the style and aesthetic of the website is mostly same as the
          version from Assignment 1, however some of the implementation and
          design to achieve this result has changed for this current assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially(for Assignment 1), the display of the games and code project
          lists were created by adding padding to the listed html elements(li
          tags), displaying them in an in-line block design, and manually
          positioning each item in the list with specific margin and position
          values to achieve the desired design. This method was inefficient as
          each item required different values for the mentioned CSS parameters
          and the correct visual spacing had do be determined through multiple
          tests of trial an error. Another issue that also arose from this
          implementation design was that the elements could only display
          correctly for the one specific viewport for which it had been
          designed, and this meant that any small change in viewport display or
          any small change in a positioning value of other elements on the page
          would result in a break of the list display(the paper cards would
          stack on top of each other and the items could not be used or
          understood).
        </p>
        <p>
          To resolve this issue, the technical implementation of the lists were
          changed to a flex display with a row direction property. The flex
          display allowed for the elements to be easily spaced and aligned on
          the page without having dependencies on the position of other elements
          on the page. This also aided in creating responsive design. For
          smaller viewports for mobile devices, the direction property is simply
          changed to a column display, without needing to make tedious manual
          position changes as with Assignment 1, which allows the elements to
          appropriately collapse and stack in an order that is appropriate for
          the mobile viewport.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technical change has also simplified the design testing process.
          The list elements could be moved and edited with ease, allowing for
          simple and quick testing to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assignment 1, the blog list was implemented using a grid display,
          however this proved to be inefficient and tedious. The blog list is
          comprised of 1 column with 7 rows, and needs to be positioned in the
          centre of the page, but the grid styling makes this process difficult.
          Similar to the process described for the games list, manual
          positioning with trial an error is required to appropriately centre
          the blog list, and this also does not collapse correctly for different
          viewports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing the display property to flex with a column direction allowed
          for the blog list to be easily centred and scaled for different
          viewports. This design also simplified the JavaScript needed to
          implement the sort by date function for the blog list, since the
          function simply had to use DOM manipulation to change to flex
          direction property of the list. This method is detailed further in the
          JavaScript section of this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          These technical changes have resulted in efficiently achieving a
          similar display and aesthetic to Assignment 1.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Creative Development and Reflection</p>
        <p>
          The creative design goal of the website was to create a website with a
          clean and minimalistic aesthetic. I wanted the website to be
          comfortable and intuitive to use. The design process, documentation
          and reflection on achieving this has been rigorously detailed and
          documented in both the Design section of this website and in the Week
          5 Critical Writing Blog Post.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section will detail the creative faults of the website from
          Assignment 1 and how they have been addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two main faults identified from Assignment 1 was the lack of
          Responsive Design and the display implementation of the Design page
          and wireframe content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first version of the website had not support for different
          viewport displays, this was poor Responsive Web Design. Lack of
          support for different viewports for a website means that less people
          are able to use and engage with the website. This is specifically
          problematic for a portfolio website, since limited engagement can
          prevent a potential employer from accessing this portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this issue, Responsive Design was added for 3 viewports:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A laptop/desktop viewport for a minimum width of 1400px</li>
          <li>A tablet viewport for a width less than 1400px</li>
          <li>A mobile viewport for a width less than 600px</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is difficult to create Responsive Design for all possible devices
          since there is a wide variety between viewport display sizes in
          different devices. I have attempted to implement possible viewport
          support for devices within specific ranges, however this does not
          ensure that every device within the range can be supported by the
          display, which is why I have ensured that the design works for the 3
          specific viewports mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design of the website remains the same between laptop/desktop
          displays and tablet displays. The design of some of the pages and
          elements have been changed to support the mobile form factor. The
          design choices and documentation for this is detailed in the Design
          section of this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The display for the Design page and wireframes was implemented using
          an embedded pdf for Assignment 1. My reasoning behind this was that a
          pdf would be easier to read and also had the benefit of being
          downloadable if desired. However this was proven incorrect as feedback
          given for the website indicted that the pdf made it difficult to
          engage with the website. I also noted that the embedded pdf did not
          scale correctly to different viewport sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this issue, the Design documents and wireframes have been
          directly added to the webpage as images. The decision behind this is
          that the images can be easily resized for laptop/desktop and tablet
          viewports, allowing for a consistent display across the different
          devices that access it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design documents and wireframes are also included as a pdf via a
          downloadable link as well(as opposed to an embedded section). This
          allows anyone to access it as a document if they wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          This addition has also been made for the purpose of the mobile view of
          the design page. It is not possible to effectively scale and position
          the images and text in a manner that is convenient to read and use on
          the mobile display. So the design has remained the same as the desktop
          view for consistency purposes, and the pdf link will provide an option
          for the user to comfortably read the designs as a document on their
          mobile device.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creative design issues from Assignment 1 have been efficiently
          resolved. The website can support 3 distinct viewports and the new
          implementation of the design page and wireframes allows for better
          user engagement.
        </p>
        <p class="boldTitle">Conclusion:</p>
        <p>
          The development of this website has been a time consuming process and
          many hours of work were needed to achieve the design goals that I set
          for this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made use of extensive semantic, technical and creative design
          practices to ensure that my website is functional based on the design
          goal I set, and based on this I believe that I have achieved my goals
          in an efficient and well executed manner.
