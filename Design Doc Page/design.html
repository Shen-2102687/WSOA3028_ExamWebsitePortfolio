            <p class="boldTitle">Viewport Display Decisions</p>
            <p class="boldTitle">Overall Style and Layout Design</p>
            <p>
                The website has been designed to have viewport support for Laptop/Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.
                 The design layout for the tablet viewport is the same as the desktop/laptop viewport - at the breakpoint
                  the elements will resize to fit the tablet viewport.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mobile viewport has been designed to have a different design layout for some pages because of the small 
                screen size. The navigation is facilitated through a bar icon, when clicked will toggle the mobile navigation tab. 
                The mobile nav tab follows the same design principles as the regular viewport. The active page will always remain 
                highlighted and any element that is selected will be briefly highlighted to indicate confirmation of selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have designed the mobile nav tab to be placed in front of all the elements on the screen in the body of the viewport 
                when it is active. This is to indicate to the user that they are using the nav tab. To prevent any issues from occurring 
                with elements behind the nav tab accidentally being accessed/clicked, the nav tab is set with an absolute position and a 
                z-index of 1, which will ensure it is placed in front of all the other elements and that none of the elements behind it can 
                be accessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The games and project list elements will collapse and stack as flex column as opposed to a row when in mobile view. This is 
                to fall in line with the mobile convention of sorting content in a top to bottom scroll format.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website has been updated to include a selectable sort button on the blogs page to sort the blogs by order of post. When 
                clicked or hovered over, this button will display a drop down list of options that can be clicked to sort the blogs. The 
                dropdown list options will be highlighted when hovered over or selected to indicate to the user that it has been selected. 
                This sort button and list have been placed to the left of the blog list to indicate to the user that the button will affect 
                the blog list.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sort button is repositioned and resized for the different viewport displays to ensure that it can be accessed across the 
                different displays.
            </p>
            <p>
                The viewport support is designed to support all viewport displays. Breakpoints for the viewports are at a width of 1400px, 
                a width of 1200px, a width of 600px, and a width of 400px. The custom styling for these different breakpoints allow the website
                to facilitate support for all viewport displays, inclusive of laptop/desktop, tablet and mobile.

            <p class="boldTitle">Style Guide, UX UI Decisions, and Style Guide Decisions</p>
            <p class="boldTitle">Overall Style and Layout Design</p>
            <p>
                The website was designed to have an overall minimalistic and clean aesthetic. I personally do not like websites that are 
                cluttered and use too many colours and images. That is the reason for the overall style of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to have the Navigation bar be the main source of colour in the website, in this case a pale dark blue, while 
                the rest of the website used white and grey tones to contrast this colour. This allowed for the website to have the 
                clean and neat effect that I wanted to achieve. I chose to use a pale blue for the nave bar and a feint white for the 
                background colour of the site so that the website would not add strain on the user's eyes while they were using it.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the Navigation bar, I decided to a feint white on the orange spectrum as the font colour. This was done so that 
                that the words could stand out more against the dark blue nav bar as opposed to plain white, which was uncomfortable 
                to look at.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Navigation bar also always has the current open page highlighted, so that the user has reference to which page 
                they are on so that they don't get confused as they browse the website. When selecting a page from the nav bar, the 
                option that is hovered over will be highlighted in a small block shape to indicate that the element can be clicked. 
                The size of the highlight for the active page is also bigger than the highlight of the hover selection - this is to 
                give the user confirmation of their selection, since the highlight will become bigger once selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the layout, I only put a few elements on each page in order to keep it neat and prevent it from feeling cluttered. 
                The elements are also placed more centrally on each page. This allows for their to be open space on the left and right 
                sides of the pages which aids in keeping the layout neat.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the elements that are selectable lists or buttons were made to look like paper-card elements. This was achieved 
                in CSS using the box-shadow properties. This was also done to achieve a neat aesthetic. This decision was also made in 
                order to provide a small feeling depth to the elements on the site, so that they did not feel completely flat and dull.
            </p>
            <p>
                As done with the Navigation bar, any other element on the site that is clickable will highlight as a different colour 
                to indicate this to the user. For the cases of the paper-card elements, they are highlighted in a feint grey tone to 
                indicate that the element has been selected. The grey tone was chosen because it contrasts the light colour of the cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Footer is situated at the bottom of every page so that it can indicate the end of a page. The Footer also serves as 
                a means to show the copyright/legal information of the website.

                These Colour Palette selections are effective in providing a clean minimalistic aesthetic, as well as be comfortable to 
                look at while browsing the website.
            </p>
            <p class="boldTitle">Font Selection</p>
            <p>
                I chose the serif font "Times New Roman" for the all the text elements in the website. I chose this font as it was easier 
                to read and more comfortable to read based on the text size compared to san-serif based fonts.
            </p>
            <p>The font helps the text look simple and elegant which lends itself the clean and neat aesthetic I want to achieve.</p>
            <p>
                When doing research for font-types, I saw several articles saying that san-serif fonts provide a minimalistic look 
                to the text, however when I tried using sans-serif fonts such as Arial and Verdana, it ended up making the text look 
                cartoonish and less comfortable to read. This is why I decided against using sans-serif fonts to try and achieve the 
                minimalistic look.

            <p class="boldTitle">Reference Material</p>
            <p>My main inspiration and sources of Reference were the websites:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prolific</li>
                    <li>Canvas(Ulwazi)</li>
                    <li>Amazon</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                My reasoning for these 
                references are that Prolific and Canvas are very minimalistic in 
                their designs and make use of good UI/UX approaches. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose Prolific for its simple layout design and colour 
                palette(mainly blue and white), and I chose Canvas for its 
                use of paper-card like elements to represent selectable areas to access new pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also used Amazon as a reference because I think the design is very cluttered and 
                busy and this is something I wanted to avoid. So having it as layout reference aided 
                me in positioning elements in a clean way.

            <p class="boldTitle">Viewport Reference Material</p>
            <p>My main inspiration sources for the mobile viewport design were:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Movies@Monte</li>
                    <li>Instagram</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                My reasonings for this is that Movies@Monte is one of the few websites I use on a 
                mobile device and I liked the form factor of the navigation. It has a bar icon that 
                can be toggled to access the navigation tab, which is displayed over the body of the 
                document and has a list of navigation options. I felt that this design was efficient 
                and functional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instagram is one of the many social media platforms that is prioritized for mobile 
                and displaying content on mobile devices. Instagram lists its content in feed formfactors, 
                where the content/posts is displayed one underneath the other. This form factor is intuitive 
                for mobile design and this is why I decided to implement a similar layout for my mobile viewport.
